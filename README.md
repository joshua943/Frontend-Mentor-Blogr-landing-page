## What I Learned
SASS is the highlight of my learning while working through this project. This is somthing I have never worked on before and had no pior knoledge how to go about it. i had to do a litte reseach on youtube and Stackover flow. At end, i was able to complete the project with SASS.

### Built with

- HTML5
- SASS
- Flexbox
- Destop-first workflow then Mobile
- JS for mobile navigation toggle

### Continued Development
While working through this project, I noticed I still needed to perfect SASS. I believe I can make a smoother transition for the mobile navigation toggle. So, I'll be working on that for the next couple of days.
